## Welcome to Studio Game: a command-line game of chance and treasure.

#### Created as part of Pragmatic Studio's Ruby (2nd Ed) class

To play: 
1. Install the gem: ``` gem install studio_game_zandster-1.0.0.gem```
2. In terminal, run ```studio_game``` to play
3. Optional: while the game comes with several default players, it's easy to create your own set of players. Create a CSV file with each of your player's name and inital health separated by a comma
    - Example:
       > Frodo, 20  
       > Gimli, 25  
       > Smeagol, 15  
       > Balrog, 30   
     - Then specify the file pathname when playing the game, i.e. ``` studio_game ~/lotr_players.csv```

4. Enjoy!
